\begin{example}[流体静力学---\refleaftext{solution4.1}]
    A fluid is rotating at constant angular velocity $\omega$ about the central vertical axis of a cylindrical container.As shown in Figure 4-1：

    (a) Show that the \itr{variation}{变化} of pressure in the \itr{radial direction}{径向} is given by $\dfrac{\dif p}{\dif r}=\rho \omega^2 r$.

    (b) Take $p=p_c$ at the axis of rotation ($r=0$) and show that the pressure $p$ at any point $r$ is
    \begin{center}
        $p=p_c+\dfrac{1}{2}\rho\omega^2 r^2$
    \end{center}

    (c) Show that the liquid surface is of \itr{paraboloidal}{抛物面的} form(Figure 4-1); that is, a vertical cross section of the surface is the curve $y=\dfrac{\omega^2 r^2}{2g}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[流体动力学---\refleaftext{solution4.2}]
    As shown in Figure 4-2, it is an \itr{air suction device}{空吸装置}. Given that the depth of the centerline of the \itr{catheter}{导管} below the liquid level in container $A$ is $h$,
    the height difference between the liquid level in container $B$ and the centerline of the horizontal catheter is $h_b$, \itr{the cross-sectional area}{横截面积} at the \itr{nozzle}{喷嘴} $d$ is $S_d$,
    and the cross-sectional area at the \itr{contraction section}{收缩段} $c$ is $S_c$. What are the conditions for the \itr{ratio}{比率} of $S_d$ to $S_c$ to occur for \itr{suction}{抽吸}?
